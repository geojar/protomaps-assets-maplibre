# Protomaps Assets Maplibre

This repository is part of the **GeoJar Protomaps Stack**. It is used to **prebuild MapLibre assets** for use on websites. This repository contains the necessary configurations and scripts to prepare the MapLibre style files and other assets.

A full setup guide is available in the GitHub repository [geojar/protomaps-stack](https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-stack).

## Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains source files including the style and configuration for MapLibre.
- **`public/`**: The final built and minified assets will be placed here after running the build process.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to a local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-assets-maplibre.git
cd protomaps-assets-maplibre
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
bash run_install.sh
```

### 3. Build the Assets
After installing dependencies, run the following command to build the assets:

```bash
bash run_build.sh
```

This process generates the MapLibre assets, including the minified `style.json` file, in the `public/` directory.

### 4. Update or Customize
To customize the asset URLs, the following files need to be updated:

- **Vite Config (base URL)**:
  Change the `base` URL in `vite.config.js` to match the desired environment:

  ```js
  base: 'https://maplibre-assets.geojar.com/',
  ```

- **`src/style.json`**:
  Modify the URLs in `src/style.json` to point to the appropriate tile, sprite, and glyph URLs:

  ```json
  "tiles": [
      "https://tiles.geojar.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"
  ],
  
  "sprite": "https://basemaps-assets.geojar.com/sprites/v4/light",
  "glyphs": "https://basemaps-assets.geojar.com/fonts/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf"
  ```

### 5. Deploy the Assets

Expose or upload the contents of the `public/` folder to the internet.  
For example, use **Cloudflare Pages** to host the directory as a static site.

### Bash Scripts

Available bash scripts:

- **`run_bash.sh`**: Opens a Docker container bash shell for interacting with the environment.
- **`run_build.sh`**: Runs the build process to generate the assets.
- **`run_install.sh`**: Runs `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- **`run_update.sh`**: Runs `npm update` to update the installed packages.

## Cloudflare Pages

After building the assets, **GeoJar** uses **Cloudflare Pages** to serve the contents of the `public/` directory. Cloudflare Pages offers a fast and secure method to deploy static websites and assets.

The content in the **`public/`** directory, including the minified style files and other assets, is uploaded to Cloudflare Pages for hosting, ensuring that the latest version of the assets is served.
